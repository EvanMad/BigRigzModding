# SCOConverter
CLI for converting the Game's sco model file format into obj files and vice versa.
Code is quite dodgey and only temporary until further research is done and I'm certain about what direction to take ths in.

For example there is a lot of ugly string sanitisation in this script i'm really not happy with, but the files have such god awful formatting it's necessary just to read them.
